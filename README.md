# Icon Validator

## What is the Reactome Icon Validator

Reactome improves the graphical representation of higher-level pathways in the Reactome pathway browser with the idea of [icon library](https://reactome.org/icon-info/icons-guidelines), this project is meant to validate the structure and value of each icon XML file.

#### icon XML file
The correct xml file should have the following structure:
```html
<metadata>
    <categories>
        <category>{CATEGORY}</category>
    </categories>
    <person orcid="{ORCID}" role="curator">{CURATOR_NAME}</person>
    <person role="designer" url="{DESIGNER_URL}">{DESIGNER_NAME}</person>
    <name>{ICON_NAME}</name>
    <description>{DESCRIPTION}</description>
    <references>
        <reference>
            <db>{REFERENCE_NAME}</db>
            <id>{REFERENCE_ID}</id>
        </reference>
    </references>
    <synonyms>
        <synonym>{SYNONYM}</synonym>
    </synonyms>
</metadata>
```
* {CATEGORY} with one or more of the suggested categories: arrow, cell_element, cell_type, compound, human_tissue, protein, receptor and transporter.
* {REFERENCE_NAME} for the name of the resource you have used to find this component (e.g.: UNIPROT, GO, CHEBI â€¦ ).
* {SYNONYM} as any synonyms or alternative names your component might be known of.

This validator validates the meaningful value of significant elements like {category}, catch the unmatching end-tags and mistaken attribute specifications, generates a validation log file in the end to display all errors. It won't cause any problems after fixing the errors in the file and then sending them to server.
